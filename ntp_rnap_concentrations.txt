The question is: does changes in [NTP] matter?

Note: molar - moles / liter

DG100 Library:
For 2006: 60% active RNAP
Each raction 10-20 uL contained:

* 30  nM template DNA in buffer
* 200 mM KCl (seems to have an effect on protein solubility)
* 100 uM NTP -- with [gamma-32P]-ATP added to 10 cpm/fmol
* 50  nM RNAP

Buffer:
 - 50mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0
 - 10mM MgCl_2
 - 10mM beta-mercaptoethanol
 - 10ug/mL acetylated BSA (a cow protein)

So, DNA and RNAP are outnumbered by a factor 10^6-7 with the other molecules in
the soup. How often do they meet? When they meet, how often do they react? Etc.
This is getting complicated.


This means that there is 30*10^-9 DNA templates and 50 nM RNAP
So almost 2 RNAP for each template. At 60% activity there is 30 nM functional
RNAP, which becomes 1 RNAP per template. How many are transcribing at the same
time? What is the kinetic competition? How often does an RNAP meet a DNA (can
you calculate this based on the reaction volume)?  We don't have to answer
these questions if we assume that [NTP] will not be rate-limiting for the
experiment.

But can we answer this question? How much is the abortive abundance
"overrepresented"? We can assume that after promoter escape, it takes so and so
much time before a full length transcript is produced. This is the expected
time to transcribe (including pauses), plus a pause toward the end (also
something about this in Lilian's 2009 review). In Lilian's studies we have no
way of coupling the radioactivity to a specific amount of nucleotide. We just
have the ratio of completed to incompleted. We kk

Each template has around 60 nucleotides that can be copied to RNA.

Assume 25% GATC on each; it's not far off since its dominated by the last 47
which are identical for all promoters. So 15 of each nucleotide, meaning
15 * 30 nM NTPs can be used for a single full length transcription reaction.
= 450 nM NTP for one full length reaction. This is actually 0.45% of the NTPs
after a single full length transcription cycle. Yet, there may be on average 10
abortive attempts for each successful attempt. What is the rate of the initial
transcription reaction? The only info we have is for the T7 RNAP.

There is 100*10^-6 NTP (of of each).

10 minutes of reaction at 37 degrees.

DG400 Library (from 'monitoring abortive initiation 2009'):

* "150 to 250 [KCl] is optimal for the N25 promoters"
    - means where one obtains the highest ration of productive vs. abortive
    - may be related to that RNAP tends to stall at fragments
    - important since abortive-ratio tends to be over-estimated due to
      functional and non-functional initiation complexes

* Higher [NTP] -> higher initiation rate. Saturated at 100 uM for N25 variants.

* 1 uL 300 nM promoter DNA
* 1 uL 10x transcription buffer (Tris-HCL, pH 8, MgCl2, etc)
* 1 uL 2M KCl
* 1 uL 1 mM NTP
* 0.5 uL gamma-phosphate-ATP
* 1 uL 500 nM RNAP

* It seems that the DG400 library has 10X of everything compared to DG100
* Yah but then divided by 10 cause it's used for 10 reactions.

-- Terminate reaction by adding 100 uL of a GES mix


-------- Other notes --------
* "Escape happens over a 4-5 nt span, unpublished" hah! I knew it.
* The nature of the DG100 and DG400 libraries (AT..) are of such that we do
  not need to consider the rates of promoter binding or promoter open complex
  formation
