Notes from "Molecular basis of transcription pausing"

# I can't get this one
* Pausing is favored by pyrimidines rather than purines at the growing RNA end (Chan and Landick, 1993)

    # I found it hard to find that pausing is favored by guanine at the incoming
      nucleotide from the article below!!!!
* Pausing is favored particularly by guanine at the incoming nucleotide
  position (Lee, Phung, Steward, Landick 1990)

transclocation of RNA polymerase II in a linear ratchet mechanism)

Notes from introduction of paper, a mini-review
* closed trigger loop positions the now-bound NTP for incorporation and blocks
  the secondary channel
* based on many studies, NTP binding (and subsequent TL folding) serves as a
  pawl that rectifies brownian translocation by not allowing backward movement
* Some studies have proposed translocation intermediates with an unfolded TL
* TL mutations that affect elongation rate affect pausing rate too
* During a pause the TL adopts a partially folded conformation

Description and results
* Use a non-equilibrium model of translocation, together with "net rate
  constants" (cleland), and michaelis menten to arrive at an expression for pause free
  translocation velocity. They then fit this expression to experiments.
* Go on to get expressions for the different rate constants
* Conclude that translocation does not reach rapid equilibrium (for Pol2)
* Still backward and forward possible, just not fast. Spends most time in
  pre-translocated state.
* Correlation between velocity and pause-frequency reflects the kinetic
  competition between elongation and the off-pathway paused state

(Forde, 2002)

* Half-life of RNAP at the end of "the line" 40 seconds; 84% reach the finish
  line. Not affected by force.

(Hsu, 2006)

* Experiments with 500 vs 100 uM shows increased productive yield, with similar
  initiation frequencies

(Weixlbaumer, 2013)
* Elemental paused state posttranslocated
* Propose that elemental paused state occurs because of loss of protein-nucleic
  acids contacs within RNAP -- not because of weak RNA-DNA hybrid
* Backtracking can occur from the elemental paused state

(Herbert, 2006)

* ~0.9 pauses per 100bp
* 7 different pause sequences: can we find them in lilian's gene?
  or can we assume anything else? Make yourself a mini-review of pause
  frequencies and duration for the paper
* expected pause-value at around 4 seconds
    - but in discussion say rate of escape at around 1/s
* all but one pause occured where a purine is added to a pyrimidine (what's the
  probability?) -- you can quickly test this for the DG100 library XXX
* No evidence for the on-pathway pauses predicted by Bai (Bai's pauses are
  similar to those that will be predicted by Nadi, should be careful)
* all pauses were found to be pre-translocated
* do not observe backtracked pauses -- but this is because of low experiment temperature
* 6/7 had G at -10 (but pre-translocated; should have 10pb hybrid?)
* 5/7 had G at +1
* 7/7 had G/C at -11

(Kireeva, 2000)
* Upstream hybrid melting influence abortive initiation

(Zhang, 2012)
* Interaction between sigma finger and template strand must be disrupted and
* sigma finger must be displaced to synthsize > 4 nt of RNA
* clamp conformations are the same in initiation as for elongation
    - initiation complex is pre-organized to proceed to elongation
* in general a reference for RNAP-nucleotide contacts during initiation (Weixlbaumer)
* equilibrium dissociation constant lower by factor of 5 for +2G compared to
  other nucleotides
* Suggests RNAP-DNA interactions for G+2 may contribute to pausing
* G+2 seems to refer to the "most downstream nucleotide of the transcription
  bubble non-template strand". From Fig 1. A this seems to be the receptor site
  for incoming NTP

(Martinez-Rucobo, 2013, Review)

* RNA-DNA helix has shape close to an A helix (probably same as free duplex)
* The 'lid' element can prevent extended RNA-DNA duplexes and stabilizes the
  open complex conformation during initiation
* Fraying is only the first step of backtracking
* At least two backtracking paths: from misincorporation and from 'pause'
* Residues contacting incoming NTP are conserved in all cellular RNA
  polymerases

(Malinen, 2012)

* In discussion, says that trigger loop can fold in the presence and absence of
  an NTP in the substrate site: if NTP present, it promotes catalysis; if not
  present, it promotes backward translocation due to affinity with the 3' end.
  What causes the trigger loop to open once NTP has bound then? Must be PPi
  somehow pushing it way out. And how does fraying and backtracking happen when
  the trigger loop is there? Maybe it opens, but instead of translocating
  forward, another reverse step happens by chance.
