Does trigger loop oscillate between open and closed or does it fold in response
to NTP binding?

Most recent articles on the trigger loop say that it folds in response to NTP
binding.

Notes from "trigger loop folding determines transcription rate of e coli rnap"

Introduction
* closed trigger loop positions the now-bound NTP for incorporation and blocks
  the secondary channel
* based on many studies, NTP binding (and subsequent TL folding) serves as a
  pawl that rectifies brownian translocation by not allowing backward movement
* Some studies have proposed translocation intermediates with an unfolded TL
* TL mutations that affect elongation rate affect pausing rate too
* During a pause the TL adopts a partially folded conformation

Notes from "Molecular basis of transcription pausing"

# I can't get this one
* Pausing is favored by pyrimidines rather than purines at the growing RNA end (Chan and Landick, 1993)
# I found it hard to find that pausing is favored by guanine at the incoming
  nucleotide from this article!!!!
* Pausing is favored particularly by guanine at the incoming nucleotide
  position (Lee, Phung, Steward, Landick 1990)

Notes from "Complete dissection of transcription elongation reveals slow
transclocation of RNA polymerase II in a linear ratchet mechanism"

* Use a non-equilibrium model of translocation, together with "net rate
  constants" (cleland), and michaelis menten to arrive at an expression for pause free
  translocation velocity. They then fit this expression to experiments.
* Go on to get expressions for the different rate constants
* Conclude that translocation does not reach rapid equilibrium (for Pol2)
* Still backward and forward possible, just not fast. Spends most time in
  pre-translocated state.

Notes (Forde, 2002)

* Half-life of RNAP at the end of "the line" 40 seconds; 84% reach the finish
  line. Not affected by force.

Notes (Hsu, 2006)

* Experiments with 500 vs 100 uM shows increased productive yield, with similar
  initiation frequencies
