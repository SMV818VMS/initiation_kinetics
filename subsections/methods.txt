w00T ! Solved full model with 253 states in just 30 seconds on 1 core on my
lousy old laptop! And the compiled solvers are much faster, just 2 seconds! :)
With 8 cores that is 4 sequences a second, or DG100 in 11 seconds. So about 5
DG100 runs a minute, or 300 in an hour. In 4 hours you get at least 1000 runs.
Which is just 10 values for 3 different parameters: you have potentially 250
different parameters. So. The problem can never be tackled by brute force. You
must divide-and-conquer. One method is to define different regimes, as
discussed before. Use linear, exponential, logarithmic, zero effect, etc. Give
over-all weights to different processes: forward, reverse, backtracking,
abortion. Then calculate parameter sensitivity on this over-all scaling. That
should allow you to exclude some obvious cases, which shows that the method is
not total BS, while it may conclude that it is not possible to distinguish
between method 1 and method 2 for example.
