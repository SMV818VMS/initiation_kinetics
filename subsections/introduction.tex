Introduction

First study looked on average translocation coefficients. Does not capture
dynamic effects.

Questions we'd like to ask:

* Can we reproduce the abortive patterns from Hsu et al.?

* Do results improve when taking into account the steric clash at ~6nt?
    -- meaning an increase in abortive initation above what is predicted by
    backtracking rate and 

* Can we estimate the ``true'' extent of abortive initiation, given that
  full-length transcripts may be lower in abundance due to stalling at the end of
  the blunt DNA?

* Is there any effect of an oscillating trigger loop?

* Is there an effect of the RNA-DNA hybrid on backtracking rate?

* Is there an effect of the RNA-DNA hybrid on the probability to release RNA?

* Can we estimate the effect of the scrunched DNA bubble on the unstability?

* Is the combined effect of an RNA-DNA stabilizing hybrid (sequence-specific)
  and a scrunched bubble (sequence-inspecific) leading to improvements?
