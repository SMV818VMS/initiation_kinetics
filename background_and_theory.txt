* readaing up on the trigger loop (also called g loop)

* since Lilian's work is not done on normal underwound DNA, one option can be
  to create an ODE model for the system, where you simplify some of the
processes (I know you worked a lot with that before: hopefully you'll do better
now). In order to do that you will need to formulate at least 3 questions that
this ODE model can answer that was not answered in your first paper. To find
those questionsk, work first with Lilian to resubmit the paper, and during this
process take note of questions that an ODE model can answer!

What can be done to write a modeling paper on the case that DNA stress is the
cause of promoter escape and abortive initiation.

This paper cannot re-use any analysis from the first paper directly.

First you have to review what exactly is meant by DNA stress in

* abortive initiation
* promoter escape

Who said What When.

This builds your case. You construct a world in which this matters for these
two situations. You explain the biochemical background for these processes.

You can hopefully cite your other paper that shows that the 3' dinucleotide is
most strongly correlated with productive yield; however, that there are still
uncertainties, such as strong abortive initiation in the first 3-6 nucleotides
that is not covered by the 3' dinucleotide theory. Also, your paper does not
cover the mechanism of abortive initiation: this presumably happens after
backtracking some steps. However, you might not need to consider backtracking,
since the extruded RNA does not contribute to stability. Just evaluate the
ensemble of scrunched states.

You must first review the literature on DNA stress to see what can be used
there. Use anything that is sequence dependent. If you cannot use anything,
what why proceed? Whatever you find, start with the basic DNA-DNA stuff. This
is not directly featured in your previous paper. Take into account maximum size
of transcrtips.

------------ Ideas 22. september ----------

(Can justify that scrunching can be considered a force that increases
backtracking: studies have been performed in this direction)
Sequence or length dependence of scrunched complex on backtracking.
1) Length dependent contribution of scrunching to backtracking rate: linear vs exponential
2) Sequence dependent contribution of scrunching (DNADNA) to backtracking rate

3) Sequence dependent or length dependent RNA-DNA stability on abortive
initiation

4) (Assumes you only do Msat in paper1) Go beyond Msat to see if that
matters/improves results.

RNA-DNA stability can be increasingly stabilizing up until 10nt, and not
contribute more to stabilization after that. This can also affect probability
of backtracking. Can also make this sequence dependent or just length dependent.

The only driver for forward movement is RNA 3' end affinity for trigger loop.

---------- Progress 29. september -------------

You have added all the parameter rates; it's now time to move on to start
setting up the reaction matrix in a flexible way.
